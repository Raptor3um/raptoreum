Raptoreum Core version 0.14.0.2
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.raptoreum.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new minor version release, bringing various bugfixes.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/raptor3um/raptoreum/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Raptoreum-Qt (on Mac) or
raptoreumd/raptoreum-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading from
version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.14.0.0

Downgrading to a version smaller than 0.14 is not supported anymore as DIP8 has
activated on mainnet and testnet.

### Downgrade to versions 0.14.0.0 - 0.14.0.1

Downgrading to older 0.14 releases is fully supported but is not
recommended unless you have some serious issues with version 0.14.0.2.

Notable changes
===============

Performance improvements
------------------------
Slow startup times were observed in older versions. This was due to sub-optimal handling of old
deterministic smartnode lists which caused the loading of too many lists into memory. This should be
fixed now.

Fixed excessive memory use
--------------------------
Multiple issues were found which caused excessive use of memory in some situations, especially when
a full reindex was performed, causing the node to crash even when enough RAM was available. This should
be fixed now.

Fixed out-of-sync smartnode list UI
------------------------------------
The smartnode tab, which shows the smartnode list, was not always up-to-date as it missed some internal
updates. This should be fixed now.
