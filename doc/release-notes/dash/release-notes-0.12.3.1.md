Raptoreum Core version 0.12.3.1
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.raptoreum.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new major version release, bringing new features, various bugfixes and other
improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Raptoreum-Qt (on Mac) or
raptoreumd/raptoreum-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.2.2

Because release 0.12.2.2 included the [per-UTXO fix](release-notes/raptoreum/release-notes-0.12.2.2.md#per-utxo-fix)
which changed the structure of the internal database, you will have to reindex
the database if you decide to use any pre-0.12.2.2 version.

Wallet forward or backward compatibility was not affected.

### Downgrade to 0.12.2.2/3

Downgrading to these versions does not require any additional actions, should be
fully compatible.

Notable changes
===============

Introducing Named Devnets
-------------------------

We introduce a new feature called [Named Devnets](https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/pull/1791).
This feature allows the creation of multiple independent devnets. Each one is
identified by a name which is hardened into a "devnet genesis" block,
which is automatically positioned at height 1. Validation rules will
ensure that a node from `devnet=test1` will never be able to accept blocks
from `devnet=test2`. This is done by checking the expected devnet genesis
block.

The genesis block of the devnet is the same as the one from regtest. This
starts the devnet with a very low difficulty, allowing us to fill up
needed balances for smartnodes very fast.

Also, the devnet name is put into the sub-version of the `VERSION` message.
If a node connects to the wrong network, it will immediately be disconnected.

New format of network message signatures
----------------------------------------

We introduced a new signature format for Raptoreum-specific network messages,
read more [here](https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/pull/1936) and [here](https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/pull/1937).
We also introduced a new spork `SPORK_6_NEW_SIGS` which is going to be used to activate the new format after the network has finished the upgrade.
Note that old pre-12.3 nodes won't be able to recognize and verify new signatures after `SPORK_6_NEW_SIGS` activates.

The old format is partly kept in the code to keep backwards compatibility. This code will be removed in an upcoming
release.

Governance system improvements
------------------------------

We do not use watchdogs since 12.2.x, instead we include all required information about sentinel into smartnode
pings. With this update we add some additional information and cover everything with a signature to ensure that
smartnode ping wasn't maleated by some intermediary node. All messages and logic related to watchdogs are
completely removed now. We also improved proposal message format, as well as proposal validation and processing,
which should lower network traffic and CPU usage. Handling of triggers was also improved slightly.

`SPORK_13_OLD_SUPERBLOCK_FLAG` was removed now as it was unused since some time.

PrivateSend improvements
------------------------

PrivateSend collaterals are no longer required to be N times of the PrivateSend fee (PSF), instead any input
which is greater or equal 1 PSF but less or equal 4 PSF can be used as a collateral. Inputs that are greater or
equal 1 PSF but strictly less than 2 PSF will be used in collaterals with OP_RETURN outputs. Note that such
inputs will be consumed completely, with no change outputs at all. This should lower number of inputs wallet
would need to take care of, improve privacy by eliminating the case where user accidentally merge small
non-private inputs together and also decrease global UTXO set size.

It might feel that thanks to this change mixing fees are going to be slightly higher on average if have lots of
such small inputs. However, you need to keep in mind that creating new PrivateSend collaterals cost some fee too
and since such small inputs were not used at all you'd need more txes to create such collaterals. So in general,
we believe average mixing fees should stay mostly the same.

There are also some other minor fixes which should also slightly improve mixing process.

Additional indexes cover P2PK now
---------------------------------

Additional indexes like `addressindex` etc. process P2PK outputs correctly now. Note, that these indexes will
not be re-built automatically on wallet update, you must reindex manually to update indexes with P2PK outputs.

Support for pruned nodes in Lite Mode
-------------------------------------

It is now possible to run a pruned node which stores only some recent blocks and not the whole blockchain.
However this option is only available in so called Lite Mode. In this mode, Raptoreum specific features are disabled, meaning
that such nodes won't fully validate the blockchain (smartnode payments and superblocks).
PrivateSend and InstantSend functions are also disabled on such nodes. Such nodes are comparable to SPV-like nodes
in terms of security and validation - it relies a lot on surrounding nodes, so please keep this in mind if you decide to
use it for something.

Default maximum block size
--------------------------

We've changed the default maximum block size to 2MB. Such blocks were already allowed before, but the default setting
for the maximum block size (which only affects miners) was kept in place until this version.

RPC changes
-----------

There are a few changes in existing RPC interfaces in this release:
- `gobject count`, `smartnode count` and `smartnode list` will now by default return JSON formatted output;
If you rely on the old output format, you can still specify an additional parameter for backwards compatibility (`all` for `count` and `status` for `list`);
- `smartnodelist` has a few new modes: `daemon`, `json`, `sentinel`;
- `debug` rpc now requires categories to be separated via `+`, not `,` like before (e.g. `raptoreum+net`);
- `getchaintips` now shows the block fork occurred in `forkpoint` field;
- `getrawmempool`'s has InstantSend-related info (`instantsend` and `instantlock`);
- `getgovernanceinfo` has new field `sentinelpingmaxseconds`;
- `getwalletinfo` now shows PrivateSend balance in `privatesend_balance` field;
- `sendrawtransaction` no longer bypasses transaction policy limits by default.
- `dumphdinfo` should throw an error when wallet isn't HD now

There is also a new RPC command `listaddressbalances`.

You can read about RPC changes brought by backporting from Bitcoin Core in following docs:
- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes
- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md#low-level-rpc-changes
- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes

Command-line options
--------------------

New cmd-line options:
- introduced in Raptoreum Core 0.12.3.1: `allowprivatenet`, `bip9params`, `sporkaddr`, `devnet`;
- backported from Bitcoin Core 0.13/0.14: `blockreconstructionextratxn`, `maxtimeadjustment`, `maxtipage`,
`incrementalrelayfee`, `dustrelayfee`, `blockmintxfee`.

See `Help -> Command-line options` in Qt wallet or `raptoreumd --help` for more info.

New Smartnode Information Dialog
---------------------------------

You can now double-click on your smartnode in `My Smartnodes` list on `Smartnodes` tab to reveal the new
Smartnode Information dialog. It will show you some basic information as well as software versions reported by the
smartnode. There is also a QR code now which encodes corresponding smartnode private key (the one you set with
mnprivkey during MN setup and NOT the one that controls the 1000 RAPTOREUM collateral) which should make the process of pairing with
mobile software allowing you to vote with your smartnode a bit easier (this software is still in development).

Testnet fixes
-------------

While we've been in release preparation, a miner used his ASICs on testnet. This resulted in too many blocks being mined
in a too short time. It revealed a few corner-case bugs in validation and synchronisation rules which we have fixed now.
We've also backported a special testnet rule for our difficulty adjustment algorithm that allows to mine a low difficulty
block on testnet when the last block is older than 5 minutes. This and the other fixes should stabilize our testnet in
case of future ASIC uses on testnet.

Using smartnode lists for initial peers discovery
--------------------------------------------------

We now use a recent smartnode list to feed the hardcoded seed nodes list in Raptoreum Core. This list was previously
unmaintained as we fully relied on DNS based discovery on startup. DNS discovery is still used as the main discovery
method, but the hardcoded seed list should now be able to serve as a proper backup in case DNS fails for some reason.

Lots of backports, refactoring and bug fixes
--------------------------------------------

We backported many performance improvements and refactoring from Bitcoin Core and aligned most of our codebase with version 0.14.
Most notable ones besides various performance and stability improvements probably are
[Compact Block support (BIP 152)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#compact-block-support-bip-152),
[Mining transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent")](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#mining-transaction-selection-child-pays-for-parent),
[Null dummy soft fork (BIP 147, without SegWit)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md#null-dummy-soft-fork),
[Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#nested-rpc-commands-in-debug-console) and
[Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#support-for-json-rpc-named-arguments).

You can read more about all changes in Bitcoin Core 0.13 and 0.14 in following documents:
- [release-notes-0.13.0.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md);
- [release-notes-0.13.1.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md);
- [release-notes-0.13.2.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.2.md);
- [release-notes-0.14.0.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md);
- [release-notes-0.14.1.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.1.md);
- [release-notes-0.14.2.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.2.md).

Note that some features were already backported earlier (per-UTXO fix, -assumevalid, GUI overlay etc.) and some were not backported at all
(SegWit and feefilter, you can read more about why we did so [here](https://blog.raptoreum.org/segwit-lighting-rbf-in-raptoreum-9536868ca861) and [here](https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/pull/2025)).
The alert system was also kept in place for now. We are going to continue backporting the most notable fixes and improvements from Bitcoin Core versions 0.15 and 0.16 in future releases.

A lot of refactoring, code cleanups and other small fixes were done in this release again. We are going to continue making code more reliable and easier to review in future releases as well.
