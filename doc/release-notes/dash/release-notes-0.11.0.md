0.11.0 Release notes
====================

Darkcoin Core 0.11.0 is forked off the Bitcoin Core 0.9.3. The old darkcoin
versions 0.10.x were forked from the Litecoin 0.8 tree. The following changes
are introduced in this major release. This list is compiled from the release
notes of Bitcoin Core  0.9.0, 0.9.1, 0.9.2, 0.9.2.1, 0.9.3 and was completed
with the introduced changes to the Darkcoin Core 0.11.0.
