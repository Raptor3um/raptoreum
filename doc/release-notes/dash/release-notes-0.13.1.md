Raptoreum Core version 0.13.1.0
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.raptoreum.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new minor version release, bringing various bugfixes and other improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/raptor3um/raptoreum/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Raptoreum-Qt (on Mac) or
raptoreumd/raptoreum-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation you will
have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate or -reindex) to make sure
your wallet has all the new data synced (only if you were using version < 0.13).

Note that there is no protocol bump in this version and thus active smartnodes
updating from v0.13.0.0 do not require any additional actions (no need to issue
`smartnode start` command).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.13.0.0

Downgrading to a version smaller than 0.13 is only supported as long as DIP2/DIP3
has not been activated. Activation will happen when enough miners signal compatibility
through a BIP9 (bit 3) deployment.

### Downgrade to 0.13.0.0

Downgrading to 0.13.0.0 is fully supported but is not recommended unless you have some serious issues with 0.13.1.0.

Notable changes
===============

DIP0003 block signaling
-----------------------
Miners running v0.13.1.0 are going to signal DIP3 regardles of the readiness of the corresponding smartnode.
With 70%+ smartnodes already running on v0.13.0.0 we believe it's safe to slightly speed up the migration
this way. This is fully backwards compatible and no update is required for (non-mining) nodes running on v0.13.0.0.

GUI changes
-----------
Smartnodes tab has a new checkbox that should filter smartnode list by using keys stored in the wallet.
This should make it much easier for smartnode owners to find their smartnodes in the list.

RPC changes
-----------
There is a new RPC command `getspecialtxes` which returns an array of special transactions found in the specified
block with different level of verbosity. Also, various `protx` commands show extended help text for each parameter
now (instead of referencing `protx register`).

Bug fixes/Other improvements
----------------------------
There are few bug fixes in this release:
- Block size should be calculated correctly for blocks with quorum commitments when constructing new block;
- Special transactions should be checked for mempool acceptance at the right time (nodes could ban each other
in some rare cases otherwise);
- Signature verification and processing of special transactions is decoupled to avoid any potential issues.
