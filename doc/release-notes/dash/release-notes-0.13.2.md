Raptoreum Core version 0.13.2.0
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.raptoreum.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new minor version release, bringing various bugfixes and other improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/raptoreum/raptoreum/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Raptoreum-Qt (on Mac) or
raptoreumd/raptoreum-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation you will
have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate or -reindex) to make sure
your wallet has all the new data synced (only if you were using version < 0.13).

Note that there is no protocol bump in this version and thus active smartnodes
updating from v0.13.0.0 or v0.13.1.0 do not require any additional actions (no need to issue
`smartnode start` command).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.13.0.0

Downgrading to a version smaller than 0.13 is not supported anymore as DIP2/DIP3 has activated
on mainnet and testnet.

### Downgrade to 0.13.0.0 or 0.13.1.0

Downgrading to 0.13.0.0 is fully supported but is not recommended unless you have some serious issues with 0.13.2.0.

Notable changes
===============

Providing "smartnodeblsprivkey" is now mandatory when the node is launched as a smartnode ("smartnode=1")
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In previous versions, "smartnodeblsprivkey" was not mandatory as these versions had to function with and without DIP3
activation. Now that DIP3 has activated on mainnet and testnet, we can make "smartnodeblsprivkey" mandatory when
configuring and running a smartnode. Please note that your smartnode will fail to start when "smartnodeblsprivkey"
is not specified. This also means that 0.13.2.0 will only work with smartnodes which have already registered their
DIP3 smartnode. This enforcement was added to catch misconfigurations of smartnodes which would otherwise stay
unnoticed until spork 15 activation and thus surprise and hurt smartnode owners.

Fix for consistency issues after sudden stopping of node
--------------------------------------------------------
Previous versions resulted in inconsistency between the chainstate and evodb when the node crashed or otherwise suddenly
stopped (e.g. power failure). This should be fixed in 0.13.2.0. 

Fix for litemode nodes to not reject specific DIP3 transactions
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previous versions might cause litemode nodes to reject the mainnet chain after spork 15 activation. This is due to a
consensus rule being less strict in one specific case when spork 15 is active. Litemode nodes can not know about the
change in consensus rules as they have no knowledge about sporks. In 0.13.2.0, when litemode is enabled, we default to the
behaviour of activated spork15 in this specific case, which fixes the issue. The restriction will be completely removed
in the next major release.

Fix incorrect behavior for "protx diff" and the P2P message "GETMNLISTDIFF"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both were responding with errors when "0" was used as base block hash. DIP4 defines "0" to be equivalent with the
genesis block, so that it's easy for peers to request the full smartnode list.
This is mostly important for SPV nodes (e.g. mobile wallets) which need the smartnode list. Right now, all nodes in
the network will respond with an error when "0" is provided in  "GETMNLISTDIFF". Until enough smartnodes have upgraded
to 0.13.2.0, SPV nodes should use the full genesis hash to circumvent the error.

Exclusion of LLMQ quorum commitments from partial blocks
--------------------------------------------------------
SPV nodes are generally not interested in non-financial special transactions in blocks, so we're omitting them now when
sending partial/filtered blocks to SPV clients. This currently only filters LLMQ quorum commitments, which also caused
some SPV implementations to ban nodes as they were not able to process these. DIP3 transactions (ProRegTx, ProUpRegTx, ...)
are not affected and are still included in partial/filtered blocks as these might also move funds. 

RPC changes
-----------
`smartnode list json` and `protx list` will now include the collateral address of smartnodes.

Bug fixes/Other improvements
----------------------------
There are few bug fixes in this release:
- Fixed a crash on shutdown
- Fixed a misleading error message in the RPC "protx update_registrar"  
- Slightly speed up initial sync by not running DIP3 logic in old blocks
- Add build number (CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD) to MacOS bundle information
