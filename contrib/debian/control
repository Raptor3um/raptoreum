Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Raptoreum is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Raptoreum Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 raptoreum-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Raptoreum is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Raptoreum uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Raptoreum Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides raptoreum-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a raptoreum daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
